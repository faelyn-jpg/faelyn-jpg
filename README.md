# Hi! I'm Kodi ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Web Developer based in Chirstchurch, New Zealand. I have a strong passion for ensuring that the web is inclusive for everyone, particularly interested in web accessibility and disability inclusion. I have experience using React, JavaScript, TypeScript, and SQLite(Knex.js). 

## ðŸŒ± About Me! 
I've recently completed my education at Dev Academy Aotearoa, where I've expanded my skills in web technologies and group collaboration. I'm driven to combine my interest in disability inclusion and web development to create functional websites that anyone, regardless of their abilities, are able to engage with. 
Beyond coding, Iâ€™m an artist, and I use this creativity in my web development work. The combination of technical skills and artistic vision allows me to craft not only functional, but visually engaging and user-friendly websites.
